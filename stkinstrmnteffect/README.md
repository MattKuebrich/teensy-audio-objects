STK Instrmnt is a wrapper of all 29 STK Instruments from The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) by Perry R. Cook & Gary P. Scavone. It includes a variety of polyphonic physically modeled and FM instruments. 

STK Effect is a wrapper of all 8 STK Effects. It includes chorus, echo, reverb and pitch shifting effects.

Although both are separate Teensy audio objects, they share files so it makes sense to package them together.
