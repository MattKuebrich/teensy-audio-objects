# FM Drum

This is a modified version of [mxmxmx's Teensy port](https://github.com/mxmxmx/minitrash/blob/master/soft/libraries/Audio/synth_fm_drum.cpp) of the FM Drum mode from the Mutable Instruments Peaks Eurorack module.

### Updates:
* The drum can be triggered with noteOn() or with a trigger at the first input. 
* The functions have been updated to take more typical value ranges for the Teensy Audio Library.
* On the Peaks module, noise and overdrive were combined in one knob. I've separated them so they can be set independently.

Note: This is pretty similar to the [SimpleDrum](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/?info=AudioSynthSimpleDrum) object that exists in the Teensy Audio Library already, although FM Drum has some different options and can get gnarlier, in a good way. :)
